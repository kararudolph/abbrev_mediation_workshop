# Causal Mediation Workshop Template [![Booklet](https://github.com/nhejazi/causal_mediation_workshops/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhejazi/causal_mediation_workshops/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nhejazi/causal_mediation_workshops/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This is the _template_ GitHub repository for the workshop **Modern Causal
Mediation Analysis**. Initially developed as a four-hour workshop
by [Iván Díaz](https://www.idiaz.xyz/), [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org),
and [Kara Rudolph](https://kararudolph.github.io/), for the [SER 2021
Meeting](https://code.nimahejazi.org/causal_mediation_workshops/), this
fork of the materials serves as a starting point for the development of future
workshops of similar content. The workshop materials are built using RStudio's
[`bookdown`](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/)
`R` package; for more information on how to use `bookdown` see
[bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/).
